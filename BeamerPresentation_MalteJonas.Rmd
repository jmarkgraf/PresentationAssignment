# Background
## Motivation

- financial crisis 2007-8: increased interest in bank-politics interface
- politicians' participation in public banks understudied
- public banks are central element of Europe's banking sector

## Institutional Setting

- large number of public savings banks (*Sparkassen*) in Germany
- *Sparkassen* important providers of credit and public goods
- regional outlook of savings banks & close ties to local politics

## Sparkassen business areas

# Argument
## Hypothesis
- mayors with board seat in savings bank extract political rents from board membership

 > **Hypothesis:**

 > *Mayors with a board seat in a Sparkasse are more likely to be re-elected than mayors without a boardseat, holding all other explanatory variables constant.*

## Storyline
How does membership in a *Sparkasse* affect electoral success?

* direct channel: influence on strategic decisions of bank
     + credit volume
     + timing of consolidation and mergers
     + donations & payouts

* indirect channel: competence signal to constituency
