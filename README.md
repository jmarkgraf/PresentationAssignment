# Presentation Assignment

This repo contains [Jonas Markgraf's](https://github.com/jmarkgraf) and [Malte Berneaud-KÃ¶tz's](https://github.com/mberneaud) in-class presentation of our research project in the Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis course at the Hertie School of Governance. 

**Instrucutor**: Christopher Gandrud

## Note regarding the data sets used in the analysis

As we do not intent to publish the data used in the analysis publicly, it needs to be manually inserted into the `data/`  directory. Otherwise, the RMarkdown will not render correctly as one of the earlier code chunks will throw an error right away.
