# Presentation Assignment

This repo contains [Jonas Markgraf's](https://github.com/jmarkgraf) and [Malte Berneaud-KÃ¶tz's](https://github.com/mberneaud) in-class presentation of our research project in the Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis course at the Hertie School of Governance. 

**Instrucutor**: Christopher Gandrud

## Note regarding the data sets used in the analysis

As we do not intent to publish the data used in the analysis publicly, it needs to be manually inserted into the `data/`  directory. Otherwise, the RMarkdown will not render correctly as one of the earlier code chunks will throw an error right away. 

## Important files
+ [R-Markdown of the presentation file](BeamerPresentation_MalteJonas.Rmd): The RMarkdown script which is used to render the in-class presentation file
+ [Out-sourced R code](standalone_R_code.R): R code for the cleaning of the data, creation of additional variables, subsetting and lagging of variables
+ [In-class presentation file](BeamerPresentation_MalteJonas.pdf): LaTeX beamer presentation that we used to present our research in class
+ [Jonas' Presentation Script](PresentationScript.docx): Word document which contains the script of Jonas' part of the in-class presentation
+ [Malte's Presentation Script](Presentation_Script_Malte.docx): Word document which contains the script of Malte's part of the in-class presentation
